# Pressure Chess

Pressure chess is a chess variant where the board reacts to action on it.

The first iteration of this variant will have a board where squares have "hit points" which decrement in value after a piece steps off of that square. Future iterations may have varying hit point decrementing per the type of action on a square (taking a piece, or movement of a certain piece), or perhaps separate HP per player (encouraging players to use their actions wisely).
